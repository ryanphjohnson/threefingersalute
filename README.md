Lame tool for hiding annoying html

Press and hold ctrl + alt, then click on the offending html. The tool will then add try to make what you clicked disappear, and never come back. You can also use ctrl + shift, then click. This is so Chromebook users can use it too. Please take a look at it, and make it smarter/faster/better, then share your changes. Team work makes the dream work :p
